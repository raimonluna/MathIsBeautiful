The chaos game is a very nice method to produce a fractal using a polygon. The idea is to start with some point in space, and then randomly choose vertices of the polygon, one at a time. Each time we choose a vertex, we introduce a new point, at some fraction of the distance between the vertex and the previous point. Usually this fraction is 1/2, so we pick the middle point as our new position.

The picture shows the result of playing the chaos game on a penthagon, with an additional rule: we cannot choose the same vertex two times in a row. This produces this mesmerizing snowflake shape, which seems adequate for these freezing winter days. If you look closely, you can see that the fractal is filled with some terrifying faces that remind me of the ancient sculptures of the Inca god Viracocha.
