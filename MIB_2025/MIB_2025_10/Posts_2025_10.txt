An Apollonian gasket is some cool geometrical construction by recursively trying to fill a large circle with smaller circles, without overlaps. Every gap between three mutually tangent circles is filled by a fourth circle, which is tangent to all three. This creates three new gaps, that are then filled by even smaller circles. 

The problem of finding a circle tangent to another three is known as the problem of Apollonius, named after the ancient Greek geometer who first solved the problem: Apollonius of Perga. This is why the Apollonian gasket got its name. However, the first description of such a construction is from the great Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1706.

The Alexander horned sphere is a rather spooky topological object. It is built by deforming a sphere into the shape of a croissant, with two horns. Then, we deform the tips of the horns into two interlaced mini-croissants with two horns each. By repeating this procedure infinitely many times, adding smaller and smaller croissants to each pair of opposing horns, we create an endless puff pastry labyrinth.

It was designed in 1924 by James Waddell Alexander II as a pathological example of a topological 3-ball which is simply connected, but whose exterior is not. This means that a closed loop inside the horned sphere can be continuously shrunk to a point while staying inside. In other words, the sphere has no "holes" in it. However, good luck trying to shrink a closed loop outside the sphere which is linked with one of its infinitely many croissants.
