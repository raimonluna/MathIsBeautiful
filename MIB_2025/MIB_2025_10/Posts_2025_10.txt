An Apollonian gasket is some cool geometrical construction by recursively trying to fill a large circle with smaller circles, without overlaps. Every gap between three mutually tangent circles is filled by a fourth circle, which is tangent to all three. This creates three new gaps, that are then filled by even smaller circles. 

The problem of finding a circle tangent to another three is known as the problem of Apollonius, named after the ancient Greek geometer who first solved the problem: Apollonius of Perga. This is why the Apollonian gasket got its name. However, the first description of such a construction is from the great Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1706.
