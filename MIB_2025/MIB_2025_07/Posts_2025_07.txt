The Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation is a fourth order differential equation with very interesting behavior, leading to an organic-looking landscape that resembles a bundle of veins and arteries. It was discovered in the 70s by  Yoshiki Kuramoto and Gregory Sivashinsky in order to model instabilities of a laminar flame front. It has also been studied recently by John C. Baez, Steve Huntsman and Cheyne Weis.

However, its interest goes beyond that of flame front. The solutions have been shown to be chaotic, and their evolution is irreversible in time. It is quite hard to integrate, as it is a stiff differential equation. In this case I used a technique called Exponential Time Differencing, as suggested by Felix KÃ¶hler in the YouTube channel Machine Learning & Simulation. These awesome numerical methods were developed by S.M. Cox and P.C. Matthews.

An autostereogram, popularly known as a magic eye picture, is an apparently nonsensical image that encodes a 3D illusion when viewed properly. The proper technique to visualize the 3D shape is called "wall-eyed convergence", and it is achieved by trying to focus both your eyes in an imaginary point behind the image. Can you see it? Let me know in the comments what you see!

The 3D illusion is created by repeating a pattern periodically in the horizontal direction. The period of repetition is chosen to vary depending on the "depth map" of the hidden landsacape. In this way, longer or shorter periods of repetition will correspond to points that appear further or closer to the observer, respectively. 

The first "random dot" autostereogram was hand-drawn by Boris Kompaneysky in 1939, but the modern pictures were created by Tom Baccei and Cheri Smith in 1991. These were commercially distributed with the name of "Magic Eye", and became very popular in the 90s and early 2000s.
