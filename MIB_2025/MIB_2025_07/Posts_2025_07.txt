The Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation is a fourth order differential equation with very interesting behavior, leading to an organic-looking landscape that resembles a bundle of veins and arteries. It was discovered in the 70s by  Yoshiki Kuramoto and Gregory Sivashinsky in order to model instabilities of a laminar flame front. It has also been studied recently by John C. Baez, Steve Huntsman and Cheyne Weis.

However, its interest goes beyond that of flame front. The solutions have been shown to be chaotic, and their evolution is irreversible in time. It is quite hard to integrate, as it is a stiff differential equation. In this case I used a technique called Exponential Time Differencing, as suggested by Felix Köhler in the YouTube channel Machine Learning & Simulation. These awesome numerical methods were developed by S.M. Cox and P.C. Matthews.

An autostereogram, popularly known as a magic eye picture, is an apparently nonsensical image that encodes a 3D illusion when viewed properly. The proper technique to visualize the 3D shape is called "wall-eyed convergence", and it is achieved by trying to focus both your eyes in an imaginary point behind the image. Can you see it? Let me know in the comments what you see!

The 3D illusion is created by repeating a pattern periodically in the horizontal direction. The period of repetition is chosen to vary depending on the "depth map" of the hidden landsacape. In this way, longer or shorter periods of repetition will correspond to points that appear further or closer to the observer, respectively. 

The first "random dot" autostereogram was hand-drawn by Boris Kompaneysky in 1939, but the modern pictures were created by Tom Baccei and Cheri Smith in 1991. These were commercially distributed with the name of "Magic Eye", and became very popular in the 90s and early 2000s.

The Ising model is a very simple model for a ferromagnetic material. A large number of "atoms" is distributed on a lattice, each one with a spin that can point up or down. Neighboring atoms interact by decreasing their energy when their spins are aligned. Even though this is a really simple model, it contains a surprising amount of physical information, including a phase transition. At low temperatures, the spins tend to align in the same direction, producing a net magnetization. However, above some critical temperature, the system becomes disordered and the magnetization drops to zero.

The square lattice Ising model was solved analytically in 1944 by Lars Onsager, in a rather complicated calculation. In this image you can see how the system looks like at the critical temperature, where the two colors correspond to two different spin orientations. Generating this image requires sampling from the Boltzmann distribution, which is quite hard as there are 2^N possible spin combinations. The configuration has been obtained by a variant of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, an extremely powerful a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, running on a GPU.

Hyperbolic space is a very particular geometry that has constant negative curvature everywhere. Together with spherical geometries, which have constant positive curvature, hyperbolic geometry is a simple example of a non-Euclidean geometry. These are geometries that do not satisfy Euclid's fifth postulate in its classical form, and have a great importance in modern Mathematics and Physics.

The picture shows a uniform tiling of the Poincaré disk, which results from a conformal compactification of 2-dimensional hyperbolic space. In this model, the entire space is "shrunk" into a disk of unit radius. This type of representations were popularized by the great mathematical artist Dutch artist M. C. Escher, in particular his Circle Limit III (1959).

The Lorentzian version of hyperbolic space, the one containing space and time coordinates, is called anti-de Sitter space and has gained an enormous interest in the field of theoretical physics. In 1997, Juan Maldacena proposed the AdS/CFT correspondence, which relates gravitational theories in anti-de Sitter space to quantum field theories living in its boundary.

A gyroid is an example of a minimal surface which appears in many biological and chemical structures. More recently, this type of geometry has been used in 3D printing to form lightweight and resistant internal structures. I have to admit that the picture above is not exact but a trigonometric approximation, as finding the actual gyroid surface is quite complicated.

Minimal surfaces are those which locally minimize their area, which means that they have zero mean curvature everywhere. These are the shapes that open soap films, or bubble films, take when stretched by a wire frame. Many other examples of minimal surfaces appear in physics, such as the horizons of black holes.
