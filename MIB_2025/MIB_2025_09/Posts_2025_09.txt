Hofstadter's butterfly is a graph of the quantum energy levels of electrons in a 2D lattice, under a magnetic field. This butterfly shape appears when the magnetic flux per unit cell is a rational multiple of the magnetic flux quantum. Its stunning fractal structure is related to the integer quantum Hall effect and topological quantum numbers.

The butterfly was first plotted by Douglas R. Hofstadter in a research paper in 1976. By analizing the spectrum of Bloch electrons under a magnetic field, he found a recurrence relation known as Harper's equation. He then noticed that the spectrum of such equation largely depended on the rationality or irrationality of its flux parameter.

The tent map is a very close relative of the logistic map. In this case, instead of iterating a parabolic function, we iterate a triangular function of the form x ---> mu * min (x, 1 - x). The name of the map comes from the fact that this triangle function looks a little bit like a traditional camping tent.

In this case I cheated a tiny bit and I flipped the axes, so it looks more like a sail. I thought it was a good opportunity to use this background music :) . The parameter mu is on the vertical axis and goes from 1 at the top to 2 at the bottom. The iterated variable x is plotted in the horizontal axis and goes from 0 to 1.
