Hofstadter's butterfly is a graph of the quantum energy levels of electrons in a 2D lattice, under a magnetic field. This butterfly shape appears when the magnetic flux per unit cell is a rational multiple of the magnetic flux quantum. Its stunning fractal structure is related to the integer quantum Hall effect and topological quantum numbers.

The butterfly was first plotted by Douglas R. Hofstadter in a research paper in 1976. By analizing the spectrum of Bloch electrons under a magnetic field, he found a recurrence relation known as Harper's equation. He then noticed that the spectrum of such equation largely depended on the rationality or irrationality of its flux parameter.
