The Julia sets (and their Fatou sets) are another big family of fractals that I haven't explored much in this channel. They were described by French mathematicians Gaston Julia and Pierre Fatou in 1918, as a starting point for the field of holomorphic dynamics. The fourth publication in this channel, the Newton fractal (MIB0004) is an example of a Fatou/Julia set.

As sets in the complex plane, they are once again related to the good old Mandelbrot, but they are somewhat complementary to it. For the Mandelbrot set, we were looking at the orbits of numbers under the iteration z --> z^2 + c. We initialized z at zero, and checked what happened for each value of c. For this family of Julia sets, we are doing the opposite. We set c to a fixed value, and check what happens for different initial values of z. In this sense, each point on the complex plane gives rise to a different Julia set.

Since we cannot go over all the points on the Mandelbrot fractal, in this video we are moving along a circle, centered at the origin, with radius R = 0.7885. The center of the image becomes dark red whenever c falls inside of the Mandelbrot set.

You are looking at the face of chaos! The double pendulum is a simple physical system where a pendulum is attached at the end of another pendulum. The motion of the double pendulum is chaotic, which essentially means that it is extremely sensitive to initial conditions. A tiny difference in the initial position will give rise to completely different behavior at later times.

In the picture above, we evolved in time a double pendulum for each pixel, starting from rest at different initial positions. The coordinates in the image correspond to the initial angles for each arm of the pendulum. Then, the color of each pixel represents the time it took for either of the rod to flip over. The black points flipped almost immediately, while the white ones never flipped during the simulation time. 

The differential equations of motion for the double pendulum are not easy to derive, and typically require the use of Lagrangian or Hamiltonian Mechanics. In this case, we focus on the simple case where both rods of the pendulum have the same length and mass. The simulation time is T = 1000 * sqrt(l / g).

Since the last post had to do with the double pendulum, I thought it was a pity not to show an animation of the actual pendulum. Actually, here I am simulating a collection of 1000 of them, with tiny variations of the initial position. Specifically, the initial angles of the rods have variations up to 2 arcseconds in both directions. Remember that 1 arcsecond is 1/3600 of a degree.At first, all of them follow very close trajectories, so close that we cannot distinguish them on the video. 

However, as the time passes they start separating from each other more and more, until become completely different. This extreme sensitivity to tiny differences in the initial conditions is what we call chaotic behavior. Chaos makes it extremely difficult to predict the future evolution of a system, even if its governing laws are perfectly deterministic. This causes long term weather forecast to be a very challenging problem, for instance.
