Differential growth is a computer algorithm that is often used in generative art in order to model the effects of natural morphogenesis.  It generates patterns that can resemble a variety of living organisms such as plants, corals, or lichens. Perhaps even the wrinkles of our brains, or the paths of rivers.

It works by setting up a long chain of particles that interact with each other by repelling or attracting depending on their relative positions. While they evolve, some adaptive mesh refinement algorithm has to be used to fill the gaps with new particles when they become too far apart.

This is a quick and dirty implementation in NumPy of the algorithm presented in the YouTube channel Programming Chaos. At this moment, the Pythonic implementation of the mesh refinement algorithm is definitely not very efficient, but hey, it works!

The Smith chart is a smart way to calculate the behavior of transmission lines and AC circuits. When dealing with high-frequency alternating currents, part of the signal travelling across a transmission line will be reflected when it encounters a load such as an antenna. The Smith chart is a graphical way to estimate the reflection coefficient and try to minimize the reflection, a procedure that is known as impedance matching. This allows us to minimize energy losses in wireless transmission.

It was introduced by Tōsaku Mizuhashi in 1937 and independently in 1939 by Phillip H. Smith and Amiel R. Volpert. The chart plots the image of the complex plane under the conformal mapping Gamma = (z - 1) / (z + 1). Using this trick, an electrical engineer can look up the normalized impedance z of the load and read the transmission coefficient Gamma without any computations. Even with modern computing, these charts are still used today.
