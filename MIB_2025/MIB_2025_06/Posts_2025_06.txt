This maze has been generated using Prim's Algorithm, which is a vey famous method in graph theory to find minimum spanning trees. The algorithm itself was first discovered 1930 by Vojtěch Jarník, but then Robert C. Prim and Edsger W. Dijkstra found it independently, and published it in 1957 and 1959 respectively. For the maze, each of the cells is treated as a vertex of a graph, which can be connected when they are adjacent and there is no wall between them. The tree structure of the graph guarantees that the solution is unique.

The solution of the maze is pretty straightforward if you start from the end, and know the minimum distance of any cell to the maze entrance. You just have to start at the end cell, and take at each step the direction that lowers the distance to the entrance. The minimum distance function is typically not so easy to find, and it usually requires an additional algorithm such as Dijkstra's algorithm. In this case, this distance function (shown as a color map), is already known from the way the maze was built.

After making the last post, I found out that the distance function for Prim's algorithm looks really cool for very large mazes. For this reason, here I generated a minimum spanning tree for a 200x200 grid, starting from its center. The colormap represents the distance, in number of edges, to the central node. 

As the graph has no closed loops, the trajectories leading to its center split into different branches. Some of them are easier to reach, you could call them shortcuts, and others require more steps to access. This creates an amazing pattern that resembles an explosion, or some portal to another world. They also remind me of the mysterious tunnels that Doctor Who uses to travel with his TARDIS.
