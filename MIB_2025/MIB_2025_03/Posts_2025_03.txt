The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where a number of disks of decreasing size, with a hole in the middle, are stacked on a pole forming an inverted conical shape. There are three different poles, and the goal of the game is to move the stack of disks to another one of the poles, subject to the following rules:

 - You can only move one disk at a time.
 - You can only place a disk on top of a smaller disk.
 
The puzzle was invented in 1883 by French mathematician Édouard Lucas. Its solution is quite interesting for mathematicians and programmers alike, as it can be understood in a recursive form. This means that you can solve the puzzle with N disks once you know the solution for N-1 disks. This makes it very easy to program, as in the movie above.The only problem is that the number of moves increases exponentially with the number of disks. Namely, for N disks you need to make 2^N - 1 moves. 

According to a legend, the priests at a temple in Benares are constantly working on a puzzle with 64 disks. The legend says that the world will end when this puzzle is completed. But do not worry, as the number of moves that are required to finish such puzzle are ridiculous. Moving a disk every second, it would take 584,542,046,091 years to complete, 42 times the age of our Universe!

Mathieu's differential equation is a generalization of the harmonic oscillator equation that appears in many physics problems involving oscillations. It was first described by  Émile Léonard Mathieu in 1868, when solving a the frequency spectrum of an elliptical drum. More modern applications include quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and even gravitation. The picture above shows part of its eigenfrequency spectrum.

Much of the knowledge we have about this equation is owed to a major figure in the field of numerical analysis: Gertrude Blanch. After finishing her PhD at Cornell in 1935, Blanch worked as the mathematical director and Chair of the Planning Committee for the Mathematical Tables Project of the Works Progress Administration during World War II.

This institution employed about 450 human computers, used to calculate numerical tables of mathematical functions, and also all kinds of numerical computations for science and technology. In some sense, Mathematical Tables Project was the equivalent at the time of a modern supercomputer. Later on, Gertrude Blanch was one of the first numerical analysts for electronic computers.

A Turing machine is an idealized model of a computer. It was introduced in 1936 by Alan Turing, as a theoretical tool to explore the limits of what can be computed in a formal system. A standard Turing machine has an infinitely long tape with symbols on it, typically 0s and 1s, and a head that reads one at a time. At every step, the head reads a symbol on the tape, and applies a particular rule. Based on the rule, it writes a different symbol, moves one step to the left or right, and changes its state to another rule. A rule can also instruct the machine to stop, or halt. 

Deciding whether a Turing machine will eventually halt or not is known as the "halting problem", and is one of the most famous problems in computer science. Of all the possible machines with n states that eventually halt, the one that lasts the longer is called the Busy Beaver. The number of steps that it takes for it to stop is known as BB(n), and its value is extremely difficult to prove. The first four of these numbers are known to be 1, 6, 21 and 107.

BB(5) was very recently found to be 47,176,870, by a collaborative project known as The Busy Beaver Challenge, where amateur mathematicians used computer-assisted proofs. The picture above shows the first 35,000 iterations of the 5-state Busy Beaver winner. Each row of pixels represents one of the iterations. This is quite probably the last Busy Beaver we will ever prove, as BB(6) seems to be so gigantic that no computer is capable of handling it.

Chladni patterns are shapes that form when a little bit of sand is placed on top of a vibrating metal plate. They were first observed by Robert Hooke on glass plates in 1680, and later on described by 1787 by Ernst Chladni by running a violin bow along the edge of a metal plate. As the modes of vibration of the plate get excited, the sand accumulates along the nodal lines and creates mesmerizing figures.

In 1808, Ernst Chladni demonstrated the technique in the Paris Academy of Sciences, which prompted Napoleon Bonaparte to set a prize for the best mathematical explanation of the phenomenon. The contest was finally won in 1816 by the french mathematician Sophie Germain, who first derived the biharmonic differential equation. The picture above shows the first 25 modes of vibration of a plate which is clamped at the edges. Not exactly Chladni's setup, but this one is easier to solve. 

These patterns are found here using spectral methods, as explained in Lloyd N. Trefethen's book. They are extracted from the same biharmonic equation that Sophie Germain derived more than two centuries ago. Notice that the 17th pattern closely resembles the typical Barcelona flower tile, designed by Josep Puig i Cadafalch, which has become a symbol of my city.
